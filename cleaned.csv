Review,Sentiment
Fast shipping but this product is very cheaply made I brought this for my grandchild so her IPod would be protected if it fell but this skin is not suitable for protection. It is only good for decoration. Therefore I rated it1*,1
This case takes so long to ship and it's not even worth it DONT BUY!!!!,1
Good for not droids. Not good for iPhones. You cannot use all the features of the watch if you have an iPhone because it won't synch to the iPhone,1
The cable was not compatible between my macbook and iphone.  Also the connector came apart and the cables started fraying.,1
The case is nice but did not have a glow light. I'm disappointed that the product didn't meet the advertisement.,1
